This project is a React front end to display the posts from the @creativecrypto Steem account. Please visit [this post](https://steemit.com/creativecrypto/@sndbox/announcing-the-creative-crypto-a-journal-for-makers-innovators-and-blockchain-creativity) for more information about the project.

If you'd like to copy or fork this repo, there are only a few changes you'll have to make to get it up and running. 

- First run `npm install` to get all of the node modules installed. 
- Then go to `src/actions/index.js`. In the `getPosts()` and `getPost()` functions, change the username to whichever Steem account you'd like to pull in posts from.
- **Additional steps are needed. I will hash these out with the main developer**
- After that it's just a matter of updating the branding and styling however you like!

It is currently in development -- more details to come soon!
